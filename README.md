# miRFA
Functional analysis of miRNA including 

1) miRNA target prediction
2) functional enrichment 
3) correlation analyses between miRNA-target genes

Description of programs:

mirna_search.R
- Contains the whole pipeline including miRNA target prediction, functional enrichment and correlation analysis.

masterpipeline.R
- The pipeline for calling the mirna_search.R script for 15 miRNAs and some post-processing steps.
